## Todo List Application  IBM
In this lab, I learned how to manage state in a React functional component using the useState hook. State variables such as todos, headingInput, and listInput are used to maintain the state of the Todo List and the user input fields.

I learned how to render headings and their associated lists based on the state maintained by React’s useState hook.

I also used code that implements event handling functions to add new headings and lists, and to handle changes in input fields. These functions update the state of the Todo List, which triggers re-renders to reflect the changes in the user interface.

Finally, I created a well-structured Todo List component with separate sections for input fields, heading display, list display, and add-list functionality. This modular structure improves code readability and maintainability.
